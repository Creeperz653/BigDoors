# This file contains all the translatable messages used in this plugin.
# If you want to modify anything, make sure to do so in a copy, as this file will be regenerated on startup!
# You can change which file will be used in the config.yml. 
# The format is "key=value" (without quotation marks). You can modify the values, but not the keys. 
# Order doesn't matter and you can use comments if you so desire.
# Please do note that white space does matter! (so spaces at the end of lines, for example).
# '\n' Means all following characters will be printed on a New Line.
# "Supported: %BLOCKSTOMOVE%" means that all following lines until the next empty line support this variabe.
# Supported variables are substituted for their actual values. For example, if a door has a blocksToMove value of 4,
# Then "This door will attempt to move %BLOCKSTOMOVE% blocks." would become:
# "This door will attempt to move 4 blocks.".
